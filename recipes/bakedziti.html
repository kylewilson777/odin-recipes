        <p><strong><em>Baked Ziti</em></strong> is a comforting and flavorful Italian-American dish that consists of ziti pasta, typically mixed with marinara sauce, ricotta cheese, mozzarella, and Parmesan, then baked to perfection. 
        The pasta is first boiled until al dente, then combined with a hearty tomato-based sauce, often enriched with garlic, onions, and Italian herbs. A generous amount of ricotta cheese is added to the mix, 
        giving the dish a creamy texture that complements the richness of the tomato sauce. The mixture is then topped with a layer of shredded mozzarella and Parmesan, creating a golden, bubbly crust as it 
        bakes in the oven.</p>
        <p>The result is a hearty, satisfying casserole that’s perfect for family meals, potlucks, or any occasion where comfort food is called for. The combination of savory tomato sauce, melted cheese, and tender pasta 
        offers a mouthwatering experience. Variations of baked ziti can include meatballs, sausage, or ground beef for added protein, or it can be made vegetarian by using extra vegetables like mushrooms, spinach, or 
        zucchini. Whether served as a main dish or paired with a side salad, baked ziti is always a crowd-pleaser.</p>
