    <h1>Chicken and Chips</h1>
    <img src="../images/chickenandchips.png" width="300" height="300">
        <p><strong>Chicken and Chips</strong> is a combination of foods predominantly consumed in the United Kingdom, The Commonwealth, and United States. It consists of a piece of fried, roasted, 
            or barbecued chicken and chips, or French fries as they are known elsewhere. The consumption of chicken and chips is a popular food choice based on its value for money.</p>
        <p> In some cities, such as London, on most high streets there are at least one or two chicken and chip shops, amongst kebab, pizza, Chinese, and Indian take-away shops. Other names for chicken and 
             chips include: Chicken fingers, chicken tenders, chicken nuggets and fries. </p>
